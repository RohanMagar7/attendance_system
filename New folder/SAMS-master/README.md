# Student Attendance Management System

Student Attendance Management System (S.A.M.S) is a web application developed for maintaining the daily attendance of students. Previously, the institutions relied heavily on paper records. The project uses a database to keep a record and uses it while generating a report for an individual student. The administrator manages the profiles and student attendance. The faculties can directly access the progress of an individual through a secure online interface. 

This system will help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student by default is set to be 85% and could be varied by the admin. The faculty can also send messages to parents or guardians about student performance and attendance by shortlisting the students. Hence the communication is facilitated with parents and faculty. The SMS sent to the mobile number of the student's guardian indicating the absence of the student.
